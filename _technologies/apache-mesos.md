title: "Apache Mesos"
description: "Open source cluster manager for providing efficient resource utilization across a cluster of servers through resource sharing and isolation. Allows a cluster of servers to be shared across diverse cluster computing frameworks so that different distributed workloads such as container orchestration, machine learning, analytics and stateful big data technologies can be run without interfering with each other. Has the ability to dynamically allocate resources across the servers as needed and delegates control over scheduling to the frameworks through an abstraction layer called a resource offer to support a wide array of computing frameworks. Resource isolation is implemented using a universal containeriser, supporting numerous containers including native Mesos containers and Docker containers. Fault tolerance of the Mesos instance in control of the cluster is implemented using ZooKeeper. Started as a research project in the UC Berkeley RAD Lab, open sourced in 2011, with a v1.0 release in July 2016, which, included the 'unified containeriser' and GPU-based scheduling. Written in C++, uses Google Protocol Buffers for messaging and serialization to allow frameworks to be written in a variety of languages including C++, Java, Python, Go, Haskell, and Scala. Under active development, open sourced under the Apache 2.0 license, hosted on the Apache git repository and mirrored on GitHub. Software startup Mesosphere sells the Datacenter Operating System, a distributed operating system, based on Apache Mesos."
